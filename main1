Linux Booting process:
The Linux boot process involves multiple stages and software components. The stages are:

GRUB: GRUB can be used to boot multiple operating systems, such as Linux or Windows.
Kernel: The kernel boots the devices and drivers, and mounts the common filesystem.
Init: Various startup scripts and daemons are executed.
Runlevel programs: Runlevel programs are executed.
